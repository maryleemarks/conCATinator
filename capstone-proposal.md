# Capstone Project Proposal

### Name: Mary Marks

### Project Name: conCATinator

This will be an app that will allow you to keep track of all your street cat friends (and foes). This project could be modified later for use by wildlife biologists, ect to keep track of other animals and even plants. 

### MVP Features

  * Authentication with the ability to log in with a username
  * Full CRUD functionality
  * Ability to add photos
  * A rating system
  * Styling
  * A map that shows all cat sightings for each cat

### Tools, Frameworks, Libraries, APIs 

This project will utilize React.js, Node.js, Redux, Firebase/Firestore (with authentication), and Google Geocode API to achieve its desired functionality. It will also use Bootstrap and other CSS to make it pretty.

### Stretch Goals

  * Add animations
  * Ability to add videos
  * Implement Typescript
  * Ability to view a map with all cat sightings of all cats on one map
  * Multiple rating systems (petability, friendliness, cuteness, ect)

### Additional Tools Required to Achieve Stretch Goals

I'm not 100% sure how to acheive my stretch goals yet, but am 75% sure that they can be acheived with the technologies above, just with a bit more coding. I think things will become more clear to me as my project grows.
